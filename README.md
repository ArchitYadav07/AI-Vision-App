### 📝 Project Overview

This AI Vision Console is a centralized Python dashboard developed by **Archit Yadav**, designed to showcase the power of real-time computer vision. By integrating OpenCV, Mediapipe, and TensorFlow, the application features an interactive suite of projects including an Invisibility Cloak that utilizes color-based background substitution, an Air Canvas for touchless digital drawing via hand tracking, and an Emotion-based Music Player that curates playlists by analyzing facial expressions. Built with a clean, dark-themed Tkinter interface, the console serves as a professional portfolio piece that bridges advanced deep learning models with accessible, user-friendly desktop utility.
